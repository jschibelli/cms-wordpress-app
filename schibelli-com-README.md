# Schibelli.com Custom Build

This repository contains a custom build for [Schibelli.com](https://schibelli.com), featuring a modern, detached frontend approach that leverages the WordPress API for content management. This solution enables a flexible, scalable website architecture that combines the robust content management capabilities of WordPress with the advanced user experience possibilities offered by modern frontend frameworks.

## Services Section

The services section is designed to showcase the various professional services offered, providing detailed descriptions, expected outcomes, and related imagery or testimonials. This section is dynamically populated with content managed through the WordPress backend, allowing for easy updates and modifications to keep the services offerings current and relevant.

## Resume Section

The resume section provides a detailed overview of professional experience, education, and skills, tailored for individuals seeking to present their professional journey in a clear, concise, and visually appealing manner. Like the services section, the resume content is dynamically fetched from WordPress, ensuring that updates to the resume are seamlessly reflected on the site without the need for manual frontend adjustments.
